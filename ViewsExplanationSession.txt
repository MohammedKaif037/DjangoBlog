They are used to maintain state information between different page requests, which is important because HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is treated independently, and the server doesn't have a built-in mechanism to associate different requests with the same user.

In your project, you're using sessions to keep track of the logged-in user. When a user successfully logs in, you store their user ID in the session using the following line:

```python
request.session['user_id'] = user.id
```

This line creates a new session key called `'user_id'` and assigns the user's ID as its value. The session data is then stored on the server-side, and a cookie containing a session ID is sent to the client's browser.

On subsequent requests, the browser will include the session ID cookie in the request headers. Django can then retrieve the session data associated with that session ID and make it available in the `request.session` object.

In your `homepage` view, you retrieve the user ID from the session using the following line:

```python
user_id = request.session.get('user_id')
```

If the `'user_id'` key exists in the session, its value (the user's ID) is assigned to the `user_id` variable. If the key doesn't exist (which would be the case if the user isn't logged in), `user_id` will be set to `None`.

Based on the value of `user_id`, you can determine whether the user is logged in or not. If `user_id` is not `None`, you retrieve the corresponding `User` object from the database and pass the user's username to the template.

When the user logs out, you remove the `'user_id'` key from the session using the following code:

```python
def logout_view(request):
    try:
        del request.session['user_id']
    except KeyError:
        pass
    return redirect('login')
```

This effectively logs the user out by removing their user ID from the session.

Sessions have a few important characteristics:

1. **Session data is stored on the server-side**: While the session ID is stored in a cookie on the client's browser, the actual session data (in this case, the user ID) is stored on the server. This means that session data is secure and cannot be tampered with by the client.

2. **Sessions have an expiration time**: Sessions are not meant to last forever. By default, Django sessions expire after two weeks of inactivity. You can configure the session expiration time in your project's settings.

3. **Sessions are tied to the browser**: A session is associated with a specific browser instance. If a user opens your site in a different browser or a private browsing window, they will have a different session, and the logged-in state will not be shared between those browser instances.

In summary, sessions allow you to maintain state information across multiple requests from the same client. In your project, you're using sessions to keep track of the logged-in user by storing their user ID in the session. When the user logs in, the user ID is stored in the session, and when they log out, the user ID is removed from the session.
